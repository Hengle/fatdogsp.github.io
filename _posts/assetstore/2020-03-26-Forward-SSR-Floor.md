## Features

+ Physically correct, support metallic and smoothness.
+ Combine screen space reflection with Unity's indirect specular.
+ Support realtime lighting and lightmap.
+ Adjustable properties for SSR quality and performance.
+ Forward SSR, mobile ready.
+ Support normal map.

## How to use

+ **Forward SSR Floor** need camera's depth texture, so you should enable camera's depth mode or add my **CameraDepthToggle** component to your main camera.

## Shader properties

#### MixMap

+ R: metallic
+ G: ambient occlusion
+ B: emission
+ A: smoothness

#### Screen Space Reflection

+ *SSR Max Ray Count*
	+ It controls the max reflected ray number for ray marching.
	+ For rough floor, you need more rays(**>=3**) to get better quality. 
	+ For smooth floor, **1-2** rays is enough.
	+ It's performance sensitive, for mobile device, it should be **<= 3**.
+ *SSR Max Sample Count* and *SSR Sample Step*
	+ Ray marching distance is controlled by **SSR Max Sample Count * SSR Sample Step**.
	+ For better quality, you need higher *SSR Max Sample Count* and smaller *SSR Sample Step*. 
	+ *SSR Max Sample Count* is performance sensitive, for mobile device, it should be **<= 10**.
+ *SSR Intensity*
	+ It controls the final SSR intensity.
+ *SSR Max Roughness*
	+ It controls the max roughness that reflects screen color.
